# Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets (kaggle Challenge)
https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started <br>

Twitter, the social media application, is the go-to place to know about the real-time happenings instantly. Monitoring tweets would be extremely useful during emergency times to know about the disaster earlier in nearby places and be precautious. But the problem arises in understanding tweets because of different meanings of the sentences depending on the context. This ambiguity in meaning of the texts is the biggest problem in monitoring tweets.<br>

This project is focused on developing a data model which has intelligence to classify tweets as the real disaster or not, based on the context. <br>

For tweet classification, the created NLP pipeline has the following steps. <br>
1. Data Collection
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Feature Engineering
5. Data Modelling (Machine learning and Deep learning models)
6. Model Evaluation
7. Model Comparison
8. Result Analysis
